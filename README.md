# Traffic Light

We are going to build a traffic light.

## Directions

1. Fork this repository, clone that fork, and open up the directory in terminal.

2. In terminal type: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`. Go to the Preview at the top of Nitrous and click on `Port 3000 (Default)`. Play around with the buttons and see what they do.

3. Back in Nitrous open up the file `index.html` and read through the html template. 

4. Open up the file `script.js` file. Fill in code in each of the following sections:
  - code for button 3 -- Turn the light Yellow 
  - code for button 4 -- Turn the light Green
  - code for button 5 -- Say GO!
  - code for button 6 -- Make Green Light Blink -- Extension!!

5. Save your changes to script.js. Go to terminal again and type: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`. Go to the Preview at the top of Nitrous and click on `Port 3000`. Check that your changes work.

6. When you're finished:
  - Stage the changes you made: `git add .`
  - Commit those changes with a message: `git commit -m "all done"`
  - Push those changed up to your fork: `git push origin master`
  - Then open up a pull request on the original repository (that you cloned from).
